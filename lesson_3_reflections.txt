1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with others on a common project
    When wanting to make your work available to others
    When seeking feedback on your work from others
    When working from more than one computer
    As back up in case of local data loss

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You can be working on something remotely which is not yet ready for sharing.
    You want to make an active decision to share from a local respository to github which is public
    Even if the files on github are private you may still not want to push everything automatically 
    as you may experiment locally and only push to github certain parts of the work.
